# Bike-Ped Portal

A national archive for bicycle and pedestrian count data. Check bicycle and pedestrian traffic volumes around the U.S. and add your own count data. Over 4 million count records from five states

- Researchers: Krista Nordback, Kristin Tufte
- **URLs**: 
    - http://bp.its.pdx.edu/
    - http://trec.pdx.edu/research/project/817
- [Bike-Ped Portal Phase II](http://trec.pdx.edu/research/project/1068/Bike-Ped_Portal_Phase_II) Ongoing

    Improve Bike-Ped Portal usability for both data providers and data users
    
    - Researchers: Hau Hagedorn, Kristin Tufte, Nathan McNeil
    - Webinar (forthcoming on 12/19):

# VWM and Bus AVL data 
Uses Vehicle wheel motion (VWM) detection data and TriMetâ€™s automatic vehicle location (AVL) data to quantifiy congestion and produce performance measures for arterials at the regional scale

- Researchers: Miguel Figliozzi, Robert Bertini
- [Report](http://nitc.trec.pdx.edu/research/project/770/Exploiting_New_Data_Sources_to_Quantify_Arterial_Congestion_and_Performance_Measures_at_a_Regional_Scale_)

# Ongoing projects

- [LRT/BRT/SCT/CRT Station Area Databases, ](http://nitc.trec.pdx.edu/research/project/1103/Updating_and_Expanding_LRT/BRT/SCT/CRT_Data_and_Analysis) Arthur Nelson
    
    A LRT/BRT/SCT/CRT station area database for 12 light rail transit (LRT) systems, 9 bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, 4 streetcar transit (SCT), and 5 commuter rail transit (CRT) systems that is being updated to 2015.

- [Bicycle and Pedestrian Traffic Monitoring Data Quality,  ](http://nitc.trec.pdx.edu/research/project/1026/Bicycle_and_Pedestrian_Traffic_Monitoring_Data_Quality) Nathan McNeil and Kristin Tufte

    Creates a practical method to quality check bicycle and pedestrian traffic counts.
